       jobs. From 
       2015 most of the company's revenue came from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales professionals.[6] Since December 2016, 
       it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As of February 2022, LinkedIn has 830+ million registered members from over 200 countries and territories.[4]

       professional relationships. Members can invite anyone (whether an existing member or not) to become a connection. LinkedIn can also be used to organize offline
       events, join groups, write articles, publish job postings, post photos and videos, and more.[7]
